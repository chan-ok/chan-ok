## Hi, There! 👋
I'm a developer with 3 years of experience.

I spent 2 years as a full-stack developer handling end-to-end web service development, and now I focus on frontend development with a strong emphasis on user experience.

I value making decisions from the user's perspective and pursue intuitive, maintainable, and well-structured code.

## 🌱 About Me

- Passionate about user-focused UI/UX design.
- Interested in building stable architectures and improving code quality.
- Enjoy learning new technologies and applying them to real-world projects.
- Currently exploring how automated testing (Unit, Function, E2E) can improve code maintenance and workflow efficiency.
